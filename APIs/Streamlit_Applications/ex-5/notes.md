# Reactivity Using Widgets

**Objective:** Create an app with a slider widget that dynamically updates a displayed number.

**Why:** To demonstrate how Streamlit's widgets can be used to create reactive apps.

**What:** We use `st.slider()` to create a slider widget that allows the user to select a value.

**How:** The `st.slider()` function creates a slider that the user can interact with. The selected value is displayed in real-time using `st.write()`.
