# Basic Streamlit App

**Objective:** Build a simple Streamlit app displaying "Hello, Streamlit!".

**Why:** The goal is to create a basic Streamlit app that displays a simple message. This is the "Hello, World!" equivalent for Streamlit.

**What:** We use the `st.title()` function to display a title on the web page.

**How:** The `st.title()` function is used to render a large title text on the Streamlit app. When you run `streamlit run app.py`, it will open a web page with "Hello, Streamlit!" as the header.
