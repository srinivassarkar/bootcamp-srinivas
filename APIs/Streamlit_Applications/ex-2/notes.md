# Multipage Streamlit App

**Objective:** Develop a multipage Streamlit app with navigation.


**Why:** To create a multipage app, we need to organize the code into separate files for each page.

**What:** We create two separate Python files, `Home.py` and `About.py`, each representing a different page in the app.

**How:** Streamlit automatically detects pages if they are in the same directory. You can navigate between pages using the sidebar.
