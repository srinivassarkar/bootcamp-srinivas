# FastAPI CRUD Example

<div class="content">

## Problem Approach

This FastAPI application demonstrates a simple CRUD API for managing items. It allows users to create, read, update, and delete items using HTTP requests.

### Why?

CRUD operations are fundamental to web applications, allowing users to manage data effectively. This example provides a clear implementation of these operations using FastAPI.

### What?

The application provides endpoints to create new items, retrieve all items, retrieve a specific item by ID, update an item, and delete an item.

### How?

The application uses FastAPI's routing capabilities to define endpoints and Pydantic models to validate request and response data. It maintains an in-memory list of items for demonstration purposes.
