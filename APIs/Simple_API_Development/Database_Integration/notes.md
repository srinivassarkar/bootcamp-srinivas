# FastAPI with SQLAlchemy Example

<div class="content">

## Problem Approach

This FastAPI application demonstrates how to create items using SQLAlchemy for database interactions. It allows users to create new items and store them in a SQLite database.

### Why?

Using a database to store data is essential for most applications. This example shows how to integrate FastAPI with SQLAlchemy to manage data persistence effectively.

### What?

The application provides an endpoint ("/items/") that accepts a request to create a new item, which is then stored in a SQLite database.

### How?

The application uses SQLAlchemy to define the database model and manage database sessions. Pydantic models are used to validate incoming data and format responses.
