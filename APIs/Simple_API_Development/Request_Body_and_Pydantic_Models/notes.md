# FastAPI Item Creation Example

<div class="content">

## Problem Approach

This FastAPI application demonstrates how to create an item using a POST request. It utilizes Pydantic for data validation and serialization.

### Why?

Creating and validating data is a common requirement in web applications. This example shows how to handle data input effectively using FastAPI and Pydantic.

### What?

The application provides an endpoint ("/items/") that accepts a JSON payload to create a new item, which includes a name and an optional description.

### How?

The application defines a Pydantic model to validate the incoming data. When a POST request is made to the endpoint, the data is validated and returned in the response.

## Python Code

<pre>from fastapi import FastAPI
from pydantic import BaseModel
from typing import Optional

app = FastAPI()

class Item(BaseModel):
    name: str
    description: Optional[str] = None

@app.post("/items/")
def create_item(item: Item):
    return item
    </pre>
