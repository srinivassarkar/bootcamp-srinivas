# Bluesky API Client


## Problem Approach

This script provides a client for interacting with the Bluesky API, allowing users to authenticate and post messages. It demonstrates the use of environment variables and object-oriented programming in Python.

### Why?

Interacting with social media APIs is essential for automating posts and managing content programmatically. This client simplifies the process of posting messages to Bluesky.

### What?

The script allows users to log in to their Bluesky account and post messages (skeets) through the API, handling authentication and error management.

### How?

Using the `atproto` library, the script initializes a client with user credentials, authenticates, and posts messages while ensuring proper error handling and input validation.
