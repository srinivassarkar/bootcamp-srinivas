<div class="content">

## Problem Approach

This script fetches the current best-selling hardcover fiction books from the New York Times API. It demonstrates how to make HTTP requests and handle JSON responses in Python.

### Why?

Accessing best-selling book data is valuable for readers, authors, and publishers to understand market trends and popular literature.

### What?

The script retrieves a list of best-selling hardcover fiction books, including their titles, authors, descriptions, publishers, and links to purchase them on Amazon.

### How?

Using the `requests` library, the script sends a GET request to the NY Times API, processes the JSON response, and extracts relevant book information.
