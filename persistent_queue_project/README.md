# Persistent Queue Project

## Overview

Welcome to the Persistent Queue Project! This system is designed to handle tasks efficiently and reliably, even if something goes wrong. Think of it as a smart to-do list that ensures every task gets done, no matter what.

## What You Need

- A computer with internet access.
- Basic knowledge of using the command line (don't worry, we'll guide you!).

## Setting Up the Project

### Step 1: Open Your Terminal

First, open your terminal or command prompt. This is where you'll type all the commands to get the project up and running.

### Step 2: Navigate to the Project Folder

Type the following command to go to the project folder:

```bash
cd ~/bootcamp-srinivas/persistent_queue_project
```

### Step 3: Install Dependencies

Next, you'll need to install some tools and libraries that the project depends on. Run these commands one by one:

```bash
pip install --user poetry
poetry install --with dev
poetry env activate
```

**Note:** The `poetry env activate` command activates a virtual environment, which is like a safe space for the project to run without affecting other parts of your computer.

### Step 4: Create Necessary Folders

The project needs some folders to store data and logs. Run this command to create them:

```bash
mkdir -p data/files logs && chmod 777 data/files logs
```

## Running the Application

### Starting the Workers

The workers are the ones who process the tasks. Start them by running:

```bash
poetry run supervisord -c supervisord.conf
```

### Launching the Manager UI

The Manager UI lets you control and manage the tasks. Start it with:

```bash
poetry run python -m streamlit run src/ui/manager.py
```

- **Access the Manager UI**: Open your web browser and go to [http://localhost:8501](http://localhost:8501).
- **Login Credentials**: Use `admin123` as the password.

### Launching the Operations (Ops) UI

The Ops UI allows you to monitor the progress of the tasks. Start it with:

```bash
poetry run python -m streamlit run src/ui/ops.py
```

- **Access the Ops UI**: Open your web browser and go to [http://localhost:8502](http://localhost:8502).

## How It Works

Hereâ€™s a simple explanation of how everything fits together:

```
+----------------+       +----------------+       +----------------+
|   Producer     | ----> | Persistent     | <---- |   Consumers    |
| (Creates Jobs) |       | Queue (SQLite) |       | (Processes Jobs)|
+----------------+       +----------------+       +----------------+
                           |         |
                           v         v
+----------------+       +----------------+
|   Manager UI   | <---- |    Ops UI      |
| (Control Jobs) |       | (Monitor Jobs) |
+----------------+       +----------------+
```

- **Producer**: This is where tasks (like files) are added to the queue.
- **Queue**: This is a storage area (using SQLite) that keeps track of all the tasks.
- **Consumers**: These are the workers that process the tasks from the queue.
- **Manager UI**: This is your control panel where you can manage and control the tasks.
- **Ops UI**: This is your monitoring panel where you can see how the tasks are progressing.

## Stopping the Application

To stop the application, simply press `Ctrl + C` in the terminal where each service is running.

## Troubleshooting

### Nothing Happens?

If nothing seems to be working, check the logs in the `logs/` directory. For example, you can look at `logs/producer.log` to see if there are any errors.

### Cannot Log In?

Make sure you are using the correct password: `admin123`.

### Still Facing Issues?

Run the following command to check if everything is set up correctly:

```bash
poetry run pytest tests/ -v
```
