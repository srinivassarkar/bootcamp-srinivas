    <h1>Safe File Processing Pipeline in Python</h1>
    <p>This example demonstrates a safe file processing pipeline that reads lines from a file, filters them based on a keyword, counts the number of words in each filtered line, and includes exception handling for file operations.</p>

    <h2>Code Implementation</h2>
    <pre>
def safe_file_processing_pipeline(filename, keyword):
    try:
        for line in filtered_file_generator(filename, keyword):
            word_count = count_words(line)
            print(f"Line: {line} | Word Count: {word_count}")
    except FileNotFoundError:
        print(f"Error: The file '{filename}' was not found.")
    except Exception as e:
        print(f"An error occurred: {e}")

# Using the pipeline with exception handling
safe_file_processing_pipeline('sample.txt', 'Python')
    </pre>

    <h2>Explanation</h2>
    <p>The <code>safe_file_processing_pipeline</code> function enhances the previous pipeline by adding error handling:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><code>try:</code> This block attempts to execute the code that processes the file.</li>
        <li><code>except FileNotFoundError:</code> This block catches the specific error if the file is not found and prints a user-friendly message.</li>
        <li><code>except Exception as e:</code> This block catches any other exceptions that may occur and prints the error message.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Approach to the Problem</h2>
    <p>The approach taken in this example is to create a robust processing pipeline that can handle errors gracefully, ensuring that the program does not crash if the specified file is missing or if other unexpected errors occur.</p>

    <h2>Why, What, and How</h2>
    <p><strong>Why:</strong> Adding exception handling improves the reliability of the program, making it more user-friendly and easier to debug.</p>
    <p><strong>What:</strong> This code defines a safe pipeline that filters lines from a file and counts the words in each filtered line while handling potential errors.</p>
    <p><strong>How:</strong> By using try-except blocks, we can catch and handle errors that may arise during file operations, providing informative feedback to the user.</p>
