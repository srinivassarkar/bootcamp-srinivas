# Safe File Processing Pipeline in Python

This example demonstrates a safe file processing pipeline that reads lines from a file, filters them based on a keyword, counts the number of words in each filtered line, and includes exception handling for file operations.

## Code Implementation

<pre>def safe_file_processing_pipeline(filename, keyword):
    try:
        for line in filtered_file_generator(filename, keyword):
            word_count = count_words(line)
            print(f"Line: {line} | Word Count: {word_count}")
    except FileNotFoundError:
        print(f"Error: The file '{filename}' was not found.")
    except Exception as e:
        print(f"An error occurred: {e}")

# Using the pipeline with exception handling
safe_file_processing_pipeline('sample.txt', 'Python')
    </pre>

## Explanation

The `safe_file_processing_pipeline` function enhances the previous pipeline by adding error handling:

*   `try:` This block attempts to execute the code that processes the file.
*   `except FileNotFoundError:` This block catches the specific error if the file is not found and prints a user-friendly message.
*   `except Exception as e:` This block catches any other exceptions that may occur and prints the error message.

## Approach to the Problem

The approach taken in this example is to create a robust processing pipeline that can handle errors gracefully, ensuring that the program does not crash if the specified file is missing or if other unexpected errors occur.

## Why, What, and How

**Why:** Adding exception handling improves the reliability of the program, making it more user-friendly and easier to debug.

**What:** This code defines a safe pipeline that filters lines from a file and counts the words in each filtered line while handling potential errors.

**How:** By using try-except blocks, we can catch and handle errors that may arise during file operations, providing informative feedback to the user.
