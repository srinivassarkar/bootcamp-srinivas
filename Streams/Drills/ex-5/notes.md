# Multiply by Two Generator in Python

This example demonstrates a generator function in Python that takes an iterator and yields each item multiplied by two. This approach allows for efficient processing of sequences without creating additional lists in memory.

## Code Implementation

<pre>def multiply_by_two(iterator):
    for item in iterator:
        yield item * 2

# Using the function
numbers = range(1, 6)  
processed_numbers = multiply_by_two(numbers)
for num in processed_numbers:
    print(num)
    </pre>

## Explanation

The `multiply_by_two` function is a generator that processes each item from the provided iterator:

*   `for item in iterator`: This line iterates through each item in the input iterator.
*   `yield item * 2`: This line yields the result of multiplying the current item by two, allowing the function to produce values one at a time.

## Approach to the Problem

The approach taken in this example is to create a generator that processes an input iterator and yields modified values. This is particularly useful for transforming data in a memory-efficient manner.

## Why, What, and How

**Why:** Using a generator for transformations allows for efficient memory usage, especially when dealing with large datasets.

**What:** This code defines a generator function that yields each number from the input iterator multiplied by two.

**How:** By using the `yield` keyword, we enable the function to produce transformed values one at a time, allowing for easy traversal in a for loop.
