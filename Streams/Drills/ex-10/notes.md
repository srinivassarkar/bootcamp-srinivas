# Advanced File Processing Pipeline in Python

This example demonstrates an advanced file processing pipeline that reads lines from multiple files, filters them based on a keyword, counts the number of words in each filtered line, and writes the results to an output file.

## Code Implementation

<pre>def advanced_pipeline(file_list, keyword, output_file):
    try:
        with open(output_file, 'w') as outfile:
            for filename in file_list:
                for line in filtered_file_generator(filename, keyword):
                    word_count = count_words(line)
                    outfile.write(f"Line: {line} | Word Count: {word_count}\n")
    except Exception as e:
        print(f"An error occurred: {e}")

# Using the advanced pipeline
file_list = ['file1.txt', 'file2.txt']
advanced_pipeline(file_list, 'Python', 'output.txt')
    </pre>

## Explanation

The `advanced_pipeline` function processes multiple files and writes the results to an output file:

*   `with open(output_file, 'w')`: This line opens the specified output file in write mode, creating it if it doesn't exist.
*   `for filename in file_list`: This loop iterates through each file in the provided list.
*   `for line in filtered_file_generator(filename, keyword)`: This line uses the previously defined generator to filter lines containing the specified keyword.
*   `outfile.write(...)`: This line writes the filtered line and its word count to the output file.

## Approach to the Problem

The approach taken in this example is to create a comprehensive processing pipeline that can handle multiple input files, making it useful for batch processing of text data.

## Why, What, and How

**Why:** An advanced pipeline allows for efficient processing of multiple files, making it easier to analyze and aggregate results.

**What:** This code defines a pipeline that filters lines from multiple files and counts the words in each filtered line, writing the results to a specified output file.

**How:** By using a combination of file handling, generators, and exception handling, we enable robust processing of text data across multiple files.
