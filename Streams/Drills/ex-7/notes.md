# Combining Iterators with itertools.chain in Python

This example demonstrates how to combine multiple iterators using the `itertools.chain` function. This approach allows for seamless iteration over multiple sequences as if they were a single sequence.

## Code Implementation

<pre>import itertools

iterator1 = range(1, 4)
iterator2 = range(4, 7)
iterator3 = range(7, 10)

# Chain them together
combined_iterator = itertools.chain(iterator1, iterator2, iterator3)

# Process the combined iterator
for item in combined_iterator:
    print(item)
    </pre>

## Explanation

The code uses the `itertools.chain` function to combine multiple iterators:

*   `itertools.chain(iterator1, iterator2, iterator3)`: This function takes multiple iterators as arguments and returns a single iterator that produces items from the first iterator until it is exhausted, then proceeds to the next iterator, and so on.
*   The `for item in combined_iterator` loop iterates through the combined iterator, printing each item.

## Approach to the Problem

The approach taken in this example is to use `itertools.chain` to create a single iterator from multiple ranges. This is useful for processing data from different sources in a unified manner.

## Why, What, and How

**Why:** Combining iterators allows for more flexible data processing and can simplify code when dealing with multiple sequences.

**What:** This code combines three ranges into a single iterator and processes the combined output.

**How:** By using the `itertools.chain` function, we can easily iterate over multiple sequences without needing to manually manage the iteration logic.
