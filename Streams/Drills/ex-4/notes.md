# Filtered File Generator in Python

This example demonstrates a filtered generator function in Python that reads lines from a file and yields only those lines that contain a specified keyword. This approach allows for efficient searching through large files.

## Code Implementation

<pre>def filtered_file_generator(filename, keyword):
    for line in file_line_generator(filename):
        if keyword in line:
            yield line

# Using the filtered generator
for line in filtered_file_generator('sample.txt', 'Python'):
    print(line)
    </pre>

## Explanation

The `filtered_file_generator` function is a generator that filters lines from a specified file based on a keyword:

*   `for line in file_line_generator(filename)`: This line uses the previously defined `file_line_generator` to iterate through each line of the file.
*   `if keyword in line`: This condition checks if the specified keyword is present in the current line. If it is, the line is yielded.

## Approach to the Problem

The approach taken in this example is to create a generator that filters lines from a specified file based on a keyword. This is particularly useful for searching through large files for specific content without loading the entire file into memory.

## Why, What, and How

**Why:** Filtering lines based on a keyword allows for efficient searching and processing of text data, making it easier to find relevant information.

**What:** This code defines a filtered generator function that yields lines from a file that contain a specified keyword.

**How:** By using the `yield` keyword in conjunction with a conditional check, we enable the function to produce only the lines that match the search criteria, allowing for easy traversal in a for loop.
