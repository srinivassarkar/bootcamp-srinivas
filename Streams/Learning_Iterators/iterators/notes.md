# Fibonacci Class and Generator in Python

This example demonstrates a Fibonacci class that implements the iterator protocol and a generator function that yields Fibonacci numbers.

## Code Implementation

<pre>from typing import Iterator

class Fibonacci:
    def __init__(self):
        self.a, self.b = 0, 1

    def __iter__(self) -> Iterator[int]:
        return self

    def __next__(self) -> int:
        result = self.a
        self.a, self.b = self.b, self.a + self.b
        return result

def fibonacci() -> Iterator[int]:
    fib = Fibonacci()
    yield from fib
    </pre>

## Explanation

The code defines a `Fibonacci` class and a generator function:

*   `class Fibonacci`: This class implements the iterator protocol with `__iter__` and `__next__` methods.
*   `__init__(self)`: Initializes the first two Fibonacci numbers, `a` and `b`.
*   `__iter__(self)`: Returns the iterator object itself, allowing it to be used in a for loop.
*   `__next__(self)`: Calculates the next Fibonacci number, updates the internal state, and returns the current number.
*   `def fibonacci()`: This generator function creates an instance of the `Fibonacci` class and yields Fibonacci numbers using `yield from`.

## Approach to the Problem

The approach taken in this example is to encapsulate the Fibonacci sequence logic within a class that adheres to the iterator protocol, allowing for easy iteration over Fibonacci numbers.

## Why, What, and How

**Why:** Using a class to implement the Fibonacci sequence allows for clear organization of state and behavior, making the code easier to understand and maintain.

**What:** This code defines a Fibonacci class that can be used to generate Fibonacci numbers and a generator function that yields these numbers.

**How:** By implementing the iterator protocol, the Fibonacci class can be used in any context that requires an iterable, such as a for loop or list comprehension.
