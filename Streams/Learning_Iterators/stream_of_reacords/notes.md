# FileRecords Class and Generator in Python

This example demonstrates a `FileRecords` class that implements the iterator protocol to read lines from a specified file, along with a generator function `file_records` that yields these lines.

## Code Implementation

<pre>import fileinput
from typing import Iterator

class FileRecords:
    def __init__(self, filename: str):
        if not isinstance(filename, str):
            raise TypeError("filename must be a string")
        self.filename = filename

    def __iter__(self) -> Iterator[str]:
        for line in fileinput.input(self.filename):
            yield line.strip()

def file_records(filename: str) -> Iterator[str]:
    if not isinstance(filename, str):
        raise TypeError("filename must be a string")
    yield from FileRecords(filename)
    </pre>

## Explanation

The code defines a `FileRecords` class and a generator function:

*   `class FileRecords`: This class implements the iterator protocol with `__iter__` method.
*   `__init__(self, filename)`: Initializes the class with a specified filename and checks if it is a string.
*   `__iter__(self)`: This method reads lines from the specified file using `fileinput.input` and yields each line after stripping whitespace.
*   `def file_records(filename)`: This generator function creates an instance of the `FileRecords` class and yields lines from the file using `yield from`.

## Approach to the Problem

The approach taken in this example is to encapsulate the logic for reading lines from a file within a class that adheres to the iterator protocol, allowing for easy iteration over these lines.

## Why, What, and How

**Why:** Using a class to implement file reading allows for clear organization of state and behavior, making the code easier to understand and maintain.

**What:** This code defines a `FileRecords` class that can be used to read lines from a file and a generator function that yields these lines.

**How:** By implementing the iterator protocol, the `FileRecords` class can be used in any context that requires an iterable, such as a for loop or list comprehension.
