# Fibonacci Generator in Python

This example demonstrates the use of a Fibonacci generator to produce Fibonacci numbers. The code skips the first 10 Fibonacci numbers and then prints the next 10.

## Code Implementation

<pre>from iterators import fibonacci  # Import the generator

fib = fibonacci()
for _ in range(10):  # Skip first 10
    next(fib)
for _ in range(10):  # Print next 10
    print(next(fib))
    </pre>

## Explanation

The code uses a Fibonacci generator to produce Fibonacci numbers:

*   `fib = fibonacci()`: This line initializes the Fibonacci generator.
*   `for _ in range(10): next(fib)`: This loop skips the first 10 Fibonacci numbers by calling `next(fib)` 10 times.
*   `for _ in range(10): print(next(fib))`: This loop prints the next 10 Fibonacci numbers after the first 10 have been skipped.

## Approach to the Problem

The approach taken in this example is to utilize a generator to efficiently produce Fibonacci numbers on demand, allowing for easy skipping and printing of specific ranges of numbers.

## Why, What, and How

**Why:** Using a generator for Fibonacci numbers is memory-efficient, as it generates numbers one at a time rather than storing them all in memory.

**What:** This code demonstrates how to use a Fibonacci generator to skip and print specific Fibonacci numbers.

**How:** By calling `next()` on the generator, we can control the flow of Fibonacci number generation, allowing for flexible usage.
