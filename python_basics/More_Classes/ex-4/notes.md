# Python Book Class with String Representation Example

<div class="content">

## Problem Approach

This Python code defines a class called `Book` that represents a book with a title and an author. The class includes two special methods: `__str__` and `__repr__`, which provide custom string representations of the class instances.

### Why?

Custom string representation methods allow for more meaningful output when printing instances of a class. The `__str__` method is intended for creating a user-friendly string representation, while `__repr__` is meant for debugging and should ideally provide a detailed representation of the object.

### What?

The `__str__` method returns a simple string that describes the book, while the `__repr__` method returns a string that could be used to recreate the object, including its attributes.

### How?

When you call `str(book)`, Python invokes the `__str__` method. When you call `repr(book)`, Python invokes the `__repr__` method. This allows for different outputs depending on the context in which the object is used.
