# Python JSON Mixin Example

<div class="content">

## Problem Approach

This Python code defines a mixin class called `JsonMixin` that provides methods for converting an object's attributes to JSON format and creating an object from JSON data. The `Person` class inherits from this mixin to utilize its functionality.

### Why?

Mixins are a way to add functionality to classes through inheritance without using a full class hierarchy. This allows for code reuse and separation of concerns, making it easier to manage and extend functionality.

### What?

The `JsonMixin` class includes two methods: `to_json`, which converts the object's attributes to a JSON string, and `from_json`, a class method that creates an instance of the class from a JSON string.

### How?

The `Person` class uses the `JsonMixin` to enable JSON serialization and deserialization. An instance of `Person` is created, converted to JSON, and then reconstructed from that JSON string.
