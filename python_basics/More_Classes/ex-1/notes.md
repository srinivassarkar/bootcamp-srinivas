# Python Book Class Example

<div class="content">

## Problem Approach

This Python code defines a simple class called `Book` that represents a book with a title and an author. Instances of the class are created to demonstrate how to use the class and access its attributes.

### Why?

Creating a class allows for the encapsulation of data and behavior related to a specific conceptâ€”in this case, a book. This makes it easier to manage and manipulate related data in a structured way.

### What?

The `Book` class has an initializer method (`__init__`) that takes two parameters: `title` and `author`. These parameters are used to set the corresponding attributes of the class.

### How?

Instances of the `Book` class are created by calling the class with the required parameters. The attributes of the instances can then be accessed using dot notation.
