    <h1>Python Context Manager Example</h1>

    <div class="content">
        <h2>Problem Approach</h2>
        <p>This Python code defines a context manager class called <code>FileOpen</code> that simplifies file handling by ensuring that files are properly opened and closed. The class implements the <code>__enter__</code> and <code>__exit__</code> methods to manage the file context.</p>
        
        <h3>Why?</h3>
        <p>Context managers are useful for resource management, such as file handling, where it is important to ensure that resources are properly released after use. Using a context manager helps prevent resource leaks and makes the code cleaner and more readable.</p>
        
        <h3>What?</h3>
        <p>The <code>FileOpen</code> class takes a filename and mode as parameters. The <code>__enter__</code> method opens the file and returns the file object, while the <code>__exit__</code> method ensures that the file is closed when the block of code is exited, even if an error occurs.</p>
        
        <h3>How?</h3>
        <p>When the <code>with</code> statement is used, the <code>__enter__</code> method is called to open the file, and the file object is assigned to the variable <code>f</code>. After the block of code is executed, the <code>__exit__</code> method is called to close the file automatically.</p>
    </div>

    <h2>Python Code</h2>
    <pre>
class FileOpen:
    def __init__(self, filename, mode):
        self.filename = filename
        self.mode = mode

    def __enter__(self):
        self.file = open(self.filename, self.mode)
        return self.file

    def __exit__(self, exc_type, exc_val, exc_tb):
        self.file.close()

# Using the context manager to write to a file
with FileOpen("example.txt", "w") as f:
    f.write("Hello, World!")
    </pre>
