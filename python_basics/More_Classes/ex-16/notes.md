# Python Context Manager Example

<div class="content">

## Problem Approach

This Python code defines a context manager class called `FileOpen` that simplifies file handling by ensuring that files are properly opened and closed. The class implements the `__enter__` and `__exit__` methods to manage the file context.

### Why?

Context managers are useful for resource management, such as file handling, where it is important to ensure that resources are properly released after use. Using a context manager helps prevent resource leaks and makes the code cleaner and more readable.

### What?

The `FileOpen` class takes a filename and mode as parameters. The `__enter__` method opens the file and returns the file object, while the `__exit__` method ensures that the file is closed when the block of code is exited, even if an error occurs.

### How?

When the `with` statement is used, the `__enter__` method is called to open the file, and the file object is assigned to the variable `f`. After the block of code is executed, the `__exit__` method is called to close the file automatically.
