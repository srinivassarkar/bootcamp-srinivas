# Python Employee and Manager Classes Example

<div class="content">

## Problem Approach

This Python code defines a class called `Employee` and a subclass called `Manager`. The `Manager` class inherits from `Employee` and adds functionality to manage subordinates.

### Why?

Using inheritance allows for code reuse and the creation of a hierarchical relationship between classes. This is a fundamental concept in object-oriented programming.

### What?

The code creates a manager and two employees, adds the employees as subordinates to the manager, and prints the manager's information, including the number of subordinates managed.

### How?

The `Employee` class has a `__str__` method for string representation. The `Manager` class overrides this method to include the count of subordinates. Instances of both classes are created, and the manager's details are printed.
