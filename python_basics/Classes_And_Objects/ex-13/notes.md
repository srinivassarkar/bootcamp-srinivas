# Python Department Class with Salary Management

<div class="content">

## Problem Approach

This Python code defines a class called `Department` that manages employees. It includes methods to add and remove employees, as well as to calculate the total salary of all employees in the department.

### Why?

Managing employee data efficiently is crucial for organizations. This implementation allows for easy addition, removal, and salary calculations for employees within a department.

### What?

The `Department` class can add employees, remove them, and calculate the total salary of all employees. It also provides a string representation of the department and its employees.

### How?

The `Department` class initializes its attributes and provides methods to manage employees. The `calculate_total_salary` method sums the salaries of all employees, and the `remove_employee` method allows for the removal of an employee by their ID.
