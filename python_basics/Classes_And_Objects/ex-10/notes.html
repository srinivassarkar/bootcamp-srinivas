    <h1>Python Employee and Department Classes Example</h1>

    <div class="content">
        <h2>Problem Approach</h2>
        <p>This Python code defines two classes: <code>Employee</code> and <code>Department</code>. The <code>Employee</code> class represents an employee with a name, position, and an optional department. The <code>Department</code> class manages a collection of employees.</p>
        
        <h3>Why?</h3>
        <p>Organizing related data and behavior into classes allows for better structure and management of code, making it easier to maintain and extend.</p>
        
        <h3>What?</h3>
        <p>The <code>Department</code> class can add employees and list them, providing a way to represent a department with its employees. The <code>Employee</code> class now includes a reference to the department it belongs to.</p>
        
        <h3>How?</h3>
        <p>The <code>Department</code> class initializes its attributes and provides methods to add employees and list them. The <code>add_employee</code> method sets the employee's department and adds them to the department's employee list. The <code>list_employees</code> method prints the names and positions of employees in the department.</p>
    </div>

    <h2>Python Code</h2>
    <pre>
class Employee:
    def __init__(self, name, position):
        self.name = name
        self.position = position
        self.department = None  # Added department attribute

class Department:
    def __init__(self, name):
        self.name = name
        self.employees = []

    def add_employee(self, employee):
        employee.department = self  
        self.employees.append(employee)

    def list_employees(self):
        for employee in self.employees:
            print(f"{employee.name} works as {employee.position} in {self.name}")
    </pre>

    <div class="note">
        <strong>Note:</strong> This code demonstrates the creation of classes in Python to represent employees and their associated department, including the relationship between them.
