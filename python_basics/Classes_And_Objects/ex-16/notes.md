# Python Project Class Example

<div class="content">

## Problem Approach

This Python code defines a class called `Project` that represents a project within a department. The class manages a list of employees assigned to the project.

### Why?

Managing projects and their associated employees is essential for effective project management. This implementation allows for easy addition of employees to a project.

### What?

The `Project` class can add employees and provide a string representation that includes the project name and the names of employees assigned to it.

### How?

The `Project` class initializes its attributes and provides methods to add employees. The `__str__` method returns a string representation of the project and its employees.
