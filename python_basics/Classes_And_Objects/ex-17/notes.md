# Python Project Class Example

## Problem Approach

This Python code defines a class called `Project` that represents a project within a department. The class manages a list of employees assigned to the project and provides methods to add, remove, and list employees.

### Why?

Managing projects and their associated employees is essential for effective project management. This implementation allows for easy assignment and removal of employees from a project.

### What?

The `Project` class can add and remove employees, list the names of employees working on the project, and provide a string representation that includes the project name, department, and employee names.

### How?

The `Project` class initializes its attributes and provides methods to manage employees. The `__str__` method returns a string representation of the project, including the department and employee names.
