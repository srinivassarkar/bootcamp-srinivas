# Python Department Class Example

<div class="content">

## Problem Approach

This Python code defines a class called `Department` that manages employees using a dictionary. The dictionary allows for quick lookup of employees by their employee ID.

### Why?

Using a dictionary to store employees provides efficient access to employee data based on their unique IDs, making it easier to manage and retrieve employee information.

### What?

The `Department` class can add employees, retrieve them by their ID, and provide a string representation of the department and its employees.

### How?

The `Department` class initializes its attributes and provides methods to add employees and retrieve them by their ID. The `__str__` method returns a string representation of the department and its employees.
