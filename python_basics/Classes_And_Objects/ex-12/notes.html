    <h1>Python Department Class Example</h1>

    <div class="content">
        <h2>Problem Approach</h2>
        <p>This Python code defines a class called <code>Department</code> that manages employees using a dictionary. The dictionary allows for quick lookup of employees by their employee ID.</p>
        
        <h3>Why?</h3>
        <p>Using a dictionary to store employees provides efficient access to employee data based on their unique IDs, making it easier to manage and retrieve employee information.</p>
        
        <h3>What?</h3>
        <p>The <code>Department</code> class can add employees, retrieve them by their ID, and provide a string representation of the department and its employees.</p>
        
        <h3>How?</h3>
        <p>The <code>Department</code> class initializes its attributes and provides methods to add employees and retrieve them by their ID. The <code>__str__</code> method returns a string representation of the department and its employees.</p>
    </div>

    <h2>Python Code</h2>
    <pre>
from typing import Dict

class Employee:
    def __init__(self, name: str, emp_id: int, position: str, salary: float) -> None:
        self.name = name
        self.emp_id = emp_id
        self.position = position
        self.salary = salary

    def __str__(self) -> str:
        return f"{self.name} ({self.position})"

class Department:
    def __init__(self, name: str) -> None:
        self.name = name
        self.employees: Dict[int, Employee] = {}  # Key: emp_id, Value: Employee object

    def add_employee(self, employee: Employee) -> None:
        self.employees[employee.emp_id] = employee  # Store by emp_id for quick lookup

    def get_employee(self, emp_id: int) -> Employee:
        return self.employees.get(emp_id, None)

    def __str__(self) -> str:
        return f"Department: {self.name}, Employees: {list(self.employees.values())}"

# Example Usage
dept = Department("IT")
dept.add_employee(Employee("Alice", 101, "Developer", 60000))
dept.add_employee(Employee("Bob", 102, "Manager", 80000))

print(dept.get_employee(101))  # Alice (Developer)
    </pre>
