# Python Employee Class with Update Methods Example

<div class="content">

## Problem Approach

This Python code defines a class called `Employee` that represents an employee with attributes such as name, employee ID, and position. It includes methods to update these attributes and display the employee's information.

### Why?

Encapsulating employee data and behavior in a class allows for better organization and management of related functionality. This is a key principle of object-oriented programming.

### What?

The code creates an instance of the `Employee` class, updates its attributes using defined methods, and prints the updated information.

### How?

The `Employee` class has methods to update the name, employee ID, and position. The `display_info` method returns a formatted string with the employee's details. An instance of the class is created, and its attributes are updated and displayed.
