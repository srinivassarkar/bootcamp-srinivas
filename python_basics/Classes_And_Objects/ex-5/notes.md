<div class="content">

## Problem Approach

This Python code defines a class called `Employee` that represents an employee with attributes such as name, employee ID, and position. It includes methods to update the position and display the employee's information.

### Why?

Encapsulating employee data and behavior in a class allows for better organization and management of related functionality. This is a key principle of object-oriented programming.

### What?

The code creates an instance of the `Employee` class, updates its position using a defined method, and prints the updated information.

### How?

The `Employee` class has methods to update the position and display the employee's details. An instance of the class is created, its position is updated, and the updated information is displayed.
