# Example Usage
dept = Department("IT")  # Create an IT department

# Create Employees
emp1 = Employee("Alice", 101, "Developer", 60000)
emp2 = Employee("Bob", 102, "Manager", 80000)

# Add employees to the department
dept.add_employee(emp1)
dept.add_employee(emp2)

# Create a project under the IT department
project = Project("Cloud Migration", dept)

# Assign employees to the project
project.add_employee(emp1)
project.add_employee(emp2)

# Display project details
print(project)  # Output: Project: Cloud Migration, Department: IT, Employees: ['Alice', 'Bob']
