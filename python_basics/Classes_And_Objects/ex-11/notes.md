# Python Employee and Department Classes Example

<div class="content">

## Problem Approach

This Python code defines two classes: `Employee` and `Department`. The `Employee` class represents an employee with attributes such as name, employee ID, position, and salary. The `Department` class manages a collection of employees.

### Why?

Using classes allows for better organization of related data and behavior, making it easier to manage and extend the code.

### What?

The `Department` class can add employees and provide a string representation that includes the department name and its employees.

### How?

The `Employee` class has a `__str__` method for string representation. The `Department` class initializes its attributes and provides methods to add employees and represent the department as a string. Instances of both classes are created, and the department's details are printed.
