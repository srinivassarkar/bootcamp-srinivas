# Python Transport Network Example

<div class="content">

## Problem Approach

This Python code defines a class called `TransportNetwork` that manages routes, schedules, and passengers. The class provides methods to add routes, update schedules, add passengers, and analyze the network.

### Why?

Managing a transport network requires efficient handling of routes, schedules, and passenger data. This implementation provides a structured way to manage these elements and perform various analyses.

### What?

The `TransportNetwork` class can add routes, update schedules, add passengers to stations, calculate the total number of unique stations, find the most frequented station, sort routes by the number of stops, and merge with another transport network.

### How?

The class uses a list to store routes, a dictionary to map routes to schedules, and a `defaultdict` to manage passengers per station. Various methods are defined to perform the required operations on the transport network.
