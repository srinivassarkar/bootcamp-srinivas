# Custom Serialization for Complex Objects

## Why Use Custom Serialization?

Complex objects like graphs require custom serialization logic because their structure may not be easily represented using standard serialization methods. Custom serialization allows you to define how to convert these objects into a format that can be easily stored or transmitted, and then reconstructed later.

## What We Will Do

We will serialize a `Graph` object containing nodes and edges, allowing us to save the graph's structure in a format that can be easily restored.

## How to Serialize a Graph

Implement custom serialization logic using dictionaries to represent the nodes and edges of the graph.
