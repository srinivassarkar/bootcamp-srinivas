2. Deserialization with Pickle:


Why: To restore the serialized object back into memory.

What: Read the serialized file and recreate the Person object.

How: Use pickle.load() to deserialize the object.


Example Flow: 
Save: pickle.dump(p, file) → writes Person object to person.pkl as bytes.
Load: pickle.load(file) → reads bytes from person.pkl, finds Person class in main.py, rebuilds the object.
