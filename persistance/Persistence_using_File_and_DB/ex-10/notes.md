# Versioning Serialized Objects

## Why Use Versioning?

Versioning serialized objects is important to handle changes in class structure over time. As applications evolve, the data structure may change, and versioning allows you to maintain compatibility with older serialized versions, ensuring that data can still be correctly deserialized and used.

## What We Will Do

We will simulate a version change in a serialized object and implement logic to handle older serialized versions, allowing for backward compatibility.

## How to Implement Versioning

We will add a version attribute to the class and update the deserialization logic to handle different versions appropriately.
