# Skipping Attributes During Serialization

## Why Skip Attributes?

Skipping attributes during serialization is important to exclude sensitive data, such as passwords or personal information, from being stored or transmitted. This helps to protect user privacy and maintain data security.

## What We Will Do

We will serialize a `User` object but skip sensitive attributes like `password`, ensuring that only non-sensitive information is serialized.

## How to Skip Attributes

You can override the `__dict__` attribute or use a custom method to control which attributes are included during serialization.
