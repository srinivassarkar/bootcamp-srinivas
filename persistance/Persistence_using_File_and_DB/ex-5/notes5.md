# Serialization with YAML

## Why Use YAML?

YAML (YAML Ain't Markup Language) is a human-readable data serialization format, often used for configuration files. Its simplicity and readability make it a popular choice for developers who need to manage complex data structures in a clear and concise manner.

## What We Will Do

We will serialize a `Car` object to YAML format, allowing us to easily store and share the car's data in a human-readable way.

## How to Serialize to YAML

Use the `PyYAML` library to serialize the object. If you don't have PyYAML installed, you can install it using pip:

<pre>pip install pyyaml
    </pre>

## Example Code

<pre>import yaml

class Car:
    def __init__(self, make, model, year):
        self.make = make
        self.model = model
        self.year = year

    def to_yaml(self):
        return yaml.dump(self.__dict__)

# Create an instance of Car
car = Car("Tesla", "Model S", 2022)

# Serialize the Car object to YAML
car_yaml = car.to_yaml()
print(car_yaml)
    </pre>
