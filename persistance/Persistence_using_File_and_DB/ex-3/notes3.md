# Serialization with JSON

## Why Use JSON?

JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) is a lightweight data interchange format thatâ€™s human-readable and widely used. It is easy to read and write for humans and easy to parse and generate for machines, making it a popular choice for data exchange between web services and applications.

## What We Will Do

We will convert a `Book` object to a JSON string, allowing us to easily store and transmit the book's data in a standardized format.

## How to Convert to JSON

Implement a `to_json()` method in the `Book` class using the `json` module to serialize the object.
