# Saving and Restoring Game State

## Why Save Game State?

Saving and restoring the state of a game or application is essential for providing users with a seamless experience. It allows players to pause their progress and return to the game later without losing any data, enhancing user satisfaction and engagement.

## What We Will Do

We will implement methods to save and load the state of a game session, allowing users to preserve their progress and resume later.

## How to Save and Load Game State

We will use the `Pickle` module to serialize and deserialize the game state, making it easy to store the current state in a file and restore it when needed.
