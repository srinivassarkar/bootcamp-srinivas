# YAML Deserialization

## Why Use YAML Deserialization?

YAML deserialization is the process of restoring a `Car` object from its YAML representation. This allows you to easily reconstruct objects from data that has been stored or transmitted in YAML format, making it convenient for data exchange between applications.

## What We Will Do

We will deserialize a YAML string back into a `Car` object, enabling us to easily convert YAML data back into a usable Python object.

## How to Deserialize YAML

Use the `yaml.safe_load()` function to parse the YAML string and create a `Car` object.

## Example Code

<pre>import yaml

class Car:
    def __init__(self, make, model, year):
        self.make = make
        self.model = model
        self.year = year

    def to_yaml(self):
        return yaml.dump(self.__dict__)

    @classmethod
    def from_yaml(cls, yaml_string):
        data = yaml.safe_load(yaml_string)
        return cls(**data)

# Example YAML string
car_yaml = """
make: Tesla
model: Model S
year: 2025
"""

# Create a Car instance from the YAML string
car_instance = Car.from_yaml(car_yaml)
print(car_instance.make)   # Output: Tesla
print(car_instance.model)  # Output: Model S
print(car_instance.year)   # Output: 2022
    </pre>
