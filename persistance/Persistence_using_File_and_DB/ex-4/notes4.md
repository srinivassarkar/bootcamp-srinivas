# JSON Deserialization

## Why Use JSON Deserialization?

JSON deserialization is the process of recreating a `Book` object from its JSON representation. This allows you to easily reconstruct objects from data that has been stored or transmitted in JSON format, making it convenient for data exchange between applications.

## What We Will Do

We will write a class method to create a `Book` instance from a JSON string, enabling us to easily convert JSON data back into a usable Python object.

## How to Deserialize JSON

Use the `json.loads()` function to parse the JSON string and create a `Book` object.
