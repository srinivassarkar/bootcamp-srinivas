# Serialization of Custom Collections

## Why Serialize Custom Collections?

Serializing custom collections, such as `MyCollection`, is important for preserving the state of complex data structures. This allows you to save and restore collections of objects easily, making it convenient for data storage and transmission.

## What We Will Do

We will implement serialization and deserialization for a custom collection class called `MyCollection`, allowing us to store and retrieve the collection of items.

## How to Serialize a Custom Collection

We will use either `Pickle` or `JSON` to serialize the collection. In this example, we will use `Pickle` for its ability to handle complex Python objects.
