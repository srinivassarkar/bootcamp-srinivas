# Serializing Cyclic References

## Why Handle Cyclic References?

Handling cyclic references is important when dealing with objects that reference each other. If not managed properly, serialization can lead to infinite loops or errors. Using a serialization method that supports cyclic references ensures that the data structure can be accurately represented and restored.

## What We Will Do

We will create two objects that reference each other and serialize them, demonstrating how to handle cyclic references using Pickle.

## How to Serialize Cyclic References

We will use Pickleâ€™s built-in ability to handle cyclic references, which allows it to track objects that have already been serialized and avoid duplication.
