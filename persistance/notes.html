The modules described in this chapter support storing Python data in a persistent form on disk. The pickle and marshal modules can turn many Python data types into a stream of bytes and then recreate the objects from the bytes. The various DBM-related modules support a family of hash-based file formats that store a mapping of strings to other strings.
what is this about, why do we use it, when do we use it, how do we use it? -> less words more info



What: Python modules (pickle, marshal, DBM-related) for saving data to disk and retrieving it later.

Why: To store Python data (objects, strings) persistently outside memory, for reuse or sharing.

When: Use pickle/marshal for serializing complex Python objects (lists, dicts, etc.); use DBM for simple key-value string storage.

How: 
Pickle: import pickle; pickle.dump(data, file) to save, data = pickle.load(file) to load.
Marshal: import marshal; marshal.dump(data, file) to save, data = marshal.load(file) to load (faster but less flexible than pickle).
DBM: import dbm; db = dbm.open('file', 'c'); db['key'] = 'value'; db.close() to store, db['key'] to retrieve.


"Disk" in this context typically refers to an SSD (Solid-State Drive) or HDD (Hard Disk Drive)—storage devices where Python data can be written to files and stored persistently for later access.


**One Liners**

Pickle: Serializes Python objects into bytes for saving to disk and reloading later.
Marshal: Fast, internal Python serializer for basic data types, mainly for .pyc files.
DBM: Stores string key-value pairs in simple, hash-based files on disk.


**Use Cases**

Pickle: Saving a trained machine learning model to disk for later predictions.
Marshal: Speeding up Python’s compilation by storing bytecode in .pyc files.
DBM: Storing user preferences as key-value pairs in a small script’s config file.
