# Fetching User with Posts using SQLAlchemy and Pydantic

## Overview

This code demonstrates how to fetch a user along with their posts from a SQLite database using SQLAlchemy and serialize the data using Pydantic.

## Key Components

*   **Pydantic Schemas:** Defines schemas for `Post` and `UserWithPosts` to validate and serialize data.
*   **Session Creation:** Establishes a session to interact with the database using SQLAlchemy.
*   **User Fetching Function:** Defines a function `fetch_user_with_posts` that retrieves a user and their posts based on user ID.
*   **Pydantic Serialization:** Uses Pydantic's `UserWithPostsSchema` to serialize the user data into JSON format.
*   **Output:** Prints the serialized user data to the console or a message if the user is not found.


## Approach Simplification

The approach can be simplified into the following steps:

1.  Import necessary modules from SQLAlchemy and Pydantic.
2.  Define Pydantic schemas for `Post` and `UserWithPosts` to validate and serialize data.
3.  Create a session to interact with the database.
4.  Define the `fetch_user_with_posts` function to retrieve a user and their posts by user ID.
5.  Use Pydantic's `UserWithPostsSchema` to serialize the user data into JSON format.
6.  Print the serialized user data to the console or a message if the user is not found.
