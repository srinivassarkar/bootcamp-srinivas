# Bulk Inserting Users with SQLAlchemy

## Overview

This code demonstrates how to perform a bulk insert of users into a SQLite database using SQLAlchemy.

## Key Components

- **Session Creation:** Establishes a session to interact with the database using SQLAlchemy.
- **Bulk Insert Function:** Defines a function `bulk_insert_users` that takes a list of user data and inserts them into the `users` table.
- **Transaction Management:** Uses a transaction to ensure that all inserts are treated as a single unit of work.
- **Error Handling:** Rolls back the transaction in case of an error and prints an error message.

## Approach Simplification

The approach can be simplified into the following steps:

1.  Import necessary modules from SQLAlchemy and the user model.
2.  Create a session to interact with the database.
3.  Define the `bulk_insert_users` function to handle bulk insertion of user data.
4.  Begin a transaction to ensure all operations are treated as a single unit.
5.  Iterate over the user data, creating `User` instances and adding them to the session.
6.  Commit the transaction if successful; otherwise, roll back in case of an error.
7.  Print a success message or an error message based on the outcome.
