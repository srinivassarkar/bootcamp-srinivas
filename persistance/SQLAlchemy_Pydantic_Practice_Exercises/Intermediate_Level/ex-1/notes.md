# Fetching User by Email with SQLAlchemy and Pydantic

## Overview

This code demonstrates how to fetch a user from a SQLite database by their email address using SQLAlchemy and serialize the data using Pydantic.

## Key Components

*   **Session Creation:** Establishes a session to interact with the database using SQLAlchemy.
*   **User Fetching Function:** Defines a function `get_user_by_email` that retrieves a user based on their email address.
*   **Pydantic Serialization:** Uses Pydantic's `UserSchema` to serialize the user data into JSON format.
*   **Output:** Prints the serialized user data to the console or a message if the user is not found.

## Approach Simplification

The approach can be simplified into the following steps:

1.  Import necessary modules from SQLAlchemy and the user model/schema.
2.  Create a session to interact with the database.
3.  Define the `get_user_by_email` function to retrieve a user by their email address.
4.  Use Pydantic's `UserSchema` to serialize the user data into JSON format.
5.  Print the serialized user data to the console or a message if the user is not found.
