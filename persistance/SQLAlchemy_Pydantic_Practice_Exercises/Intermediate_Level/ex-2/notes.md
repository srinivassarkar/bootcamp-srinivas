# Updating User Email with SQLAlchemy

## Overview

This code demonstrates how to update a user's email address in a SQLite database using SQLAlchemy.

## Key Components

- **Session Creation:** Establishes a session to interact with the database using SQLAlchemy.
- **User Update Function:** Defines a function `update_user_email` that updates the email of a user based on their user ID.
- **Commit Changes:** Commits the changes to the database and prints a success message.
- **Error Handling:** Prints a message if the user is not found.

## Approach Simplification

The approach can be simplified into the following steps:

1.  Import necessary modules from SQLAlchemy and the user model.
2.  Create a session to interact with the database.
3.  Define the `update_user_email` function to update a user's email address.
4.  Query the user by their ID and update the email if the user exists.
5.  Commit the changes to the database and print a success message or an error message if the user is not found.
