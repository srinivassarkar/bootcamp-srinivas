# Multi-Table Transaction Management in SQLite

## Overview

This code defines a function `multi_table_transaction` that demonstrates how to perform a transaction involving multiple tables in a SQLite database by inserting an order and its corresponding details.

## Key Components

- **Database Connection:** Establishes a connection to the SQLite database.
- **Transaction Management:** Uses a transaction to ensure that multiple insert operations across different tables are treated as a single unit of work.
- **Order Insertion:** Inserts a new order into the `orders` table and retrieves the generated order ID.
- **Order Details Insertion:** Inserts corresponding details into the `order_details` table using the retrieved order ID.
- **Error Handling:** Catches errors and rolls back the transaction if any issues occur during the insertions.
- **Closing Connection:** Ensures the database connection is closed after operations are complete.

## Approach Simplification

The approach can be simplified into the following steps:

1.  Establish a connection to the SQLite database.
2.  Begin a transaction to ensure that all operations are treated as a single unit.
3.  Insert a new order into the `orders` table and retrieve the generated order ID.
4.  Insert corresponding details into the `order_details` table using the retrieved order ID.
5.  Commit the transaction if all operations succeed; otherwise, roll back in case of an error.
6.  Close the database connection after operations are complete.
