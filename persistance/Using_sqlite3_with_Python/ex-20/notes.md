# Inventory Update Management in SQLite

## Overview

This code defines a function `update_inventory` that demonstrates how to update the inventory of a product in a SQLite database while logging the changes.

## Key Components

- **Database Connection:** Establishes a connection to the SQLite database.
- **Transaction Management:** Uses a transaction to ensure that both the stock update and the log entry are treated as a single unit of work.
- **Stock Update:** Updates the stock of the specified product by applying the quantity change.
- **Inventory Logging:** Inserts a record into the `inventory_log` table to track the change in inventory.
- **Error Handling:** Catches errors and rolls back the transaction if any issues occur during the update.
- **Closing Connection:** Ensures the database connection is closed after operations are complete.

## Approach Simplification

The approach can be simplified into the following steps:

1.  Establish a connection to the SQLite database.
2.  Begin a transaction to ensure that both operations are treated as a single unit.
3.  Update the stock of the specified product by applying the quantity change.
4.  Log the inventory change in the `inventory_log` table.
5.  Commit the transaction if both operations succeed; otherwise, roll back in case of an error.
6.  Close the database connection after operations are complete.
