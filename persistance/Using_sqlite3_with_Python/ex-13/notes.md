# Calculating Total Value of Products in SQLite

## Overview

This code defines a `Product` class that connects to a SQLite database and calculates the total value of all products stored in the `products` table.

## Key Components

*   **Database Connection:** Establishes a connection to the SQLite database.
*   **Total Value Calculation:** Uses SQL to calculate the sum of the prices of all products.
*   **Closing Connection:** Ensures the database connection is closed after operations are complete.

## Code Breakdown

    import sqlite3

    class Product:
        def __init__(self):
            self.conn = sqlite3.connect('store.db')
            self.cursor = self.conn.cursor()

        def total_value(self):
            self.cursor.execute('SELECT SUM(price) FROM products')
            return self.cursor.fetchone()[0]

        def close(self):
            self.conn.close()

    if __name__ == "__main__":
        product = Product()
        print(f"Total value: {product.total_value()}")
        product.close()

## Approach Simplification

The approach can be simplified into the following steps:

1.  Establish a connection to the SQLite database.
2.  Execute a SQL query to calculate the total value of all products by summing their prices.
3.  Fetch the result and return the total value.
4.  Close the database connection after operations are complete.
