# Exporting Products to CSV from SQLite

## Overview

This code defines a function `export_to_csv` that connects to a SQLite database and exports the data from the `products` table into a CSV file.

## Key Components

*   **Database Connection:** Establishes a connection to the SQLite database.
*   **Data Retrieval:** Executes a SQL query to fetch all records from the `products` table.
*   **CSV Writing:** Uses the `csv` module to write the fetched data into a CSV file.
*   **Closing Connection:** Ensures the database connection is closed after operations are complete.

## Code Breakdown

    import sqlite3
    import csv

    def export_to_csv():
        conn = sqlite3.connect('store.db')
        cursor = conn.cursor()
        cursor.execute('SELECT * FROM products')
        with open('products.csv', 'w', newline='') as file:
            writer = csv.writer(file)
            writer.writerow([i[0] for i in cursor.description])  # Write headers
            writer.writerows(cursor.fetchall())
        conn.close()

    if __name__ == "__main__":
        export_to_csv()

## Approach Simplification

The approach can be simplified into the following steps:

1.  Establish a connection to the SQLite database.
2.  Execute a SQL query to retrieve all records from the `products` table.
3.  Open a CSV file for writing and create a CSV writer object.
4.  Write the column headers to the CSV file.
5.  Write all product records to the CSV file.
6.  Close the database connection after operations are complete.
