# Product and Category Management in SQLite

## Overview

This code defines a `Product` class that manages products and their associated categories in a SQLite database. It creates necessary tables and fetches products along with their categories.

## Key Components

*   **Database Connection:** Establishes a connection to the SQLite database and creates tables for categories and product-category relationships.
*   **Table Creation:** Ensures that the `categories` and `product_category` tables exist.
*   **Fetching Data:** Retrieves products along with their associated categories using SQL JOIN operations.

## Approach Simplification

The approach can be simplified into the following steps:

1.  Establish a connection to the SQLite database.
2.  Create tables for `categories` and the relationship between products and categories.
3.  Fetch product names along with their associated category names using SQL JOINs.
4.  Close the database connection after operations are complete.
