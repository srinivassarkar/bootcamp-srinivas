# Batch Transaction Management in SQLite

## Overview

This code defines a function `batch_transaction` that demonstrates how to perform batch insertion of multiple products into a SQLite database using transaction management.

## Key Components

- **Database Connection:** Establishes a connection to the SQLite database.
- **Batch Insertion:** Uses the `executemany` method to insert multiple products in a single operation.
- **Transaction Management:** Implements transaction handling to ensure data integrity during batch operations.
- **Error Handling:** Catches errors and rolls back the transaction if any issues occur during insertion.
- **Closing Connection:** Ensures the database connection is closed after operations are complete.

## Approach Simplification

The approach can be simplified into the following steps:

1.  Establish a connection to the SQLite database.
2.  Prepare a list of products to be inserted.
3.  Begin a transaction to ensure data integrity.
4.  Use `executemany` to insert multiple products in one go.
5.  Commit the transaction if successful; otherwise, roll back in case of an error.
6.  Close the database connection after operations are complete.
