# Fund Transfer Management in SQLite

## Overview

This code defines a function `transfer_funds` that demonstrates how to transfer funds between two accounts in a SQLite database using transaction management.

## Key Components

*   **Database Connection:** Establishes a connection to the SQLite database.
*   **Transaction Management:** Uses a transaction to ensure that both debit and credit operations are treated as a single unit of work.
*   **Account Update:** Updates the balance of the source account by deducting the transfer amount and updates the destination account by adding the same amount.
*   **Error Handling:** Catches errors and rolls back the transaction if any issues occur during the fund transfer.
*   **Closing Connection:** Ensures the database connection is closed after operations are complete.


## Approach Simplification

The approach can be simplified into the following steps:

1.  Establish a connection to the SQLite database.
2.  Begin a transaction to ensure that both operations are treated as a single unit.
3.  Update the balance of the source account by deducting the transfer amount.
4.  Update the balance of the destination account by adding the transfer amount.
5.  Commit the transaction if both operations succeed; otherwise, roll back in case of an error.
6.  Close the database connection after operations are complete.
