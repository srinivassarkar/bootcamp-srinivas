# Understanding Product Class with Transaction Management

## Overview

The `Product` class manages products in a SQLite database. The `add_product` method adds a new product while ensuring safe operations through transaction management.

## Key Components

- **Database Connection:** Initializes a connection to the SQLite database.
- **Transaction Management:** Uses transactions to ensure data consistency.
- **Error Handling:** Catches errors and rolls back transactions if needed.

## Code Breakdown

    def add_product(self, name, price):
        try:
            self.conn.execute('BEGIN TRANSACTION')  # Start a new transaction
            self.cursor.execute('INSERT INTO products (name, price) VALUES (?, ?)', (name, price))  # Insert product
            self.conn.commit()  # Commit the transaction if successful
        except sqlite3.Error as e:  # Catch any SQLite errors
            self.conn.rollback()  # Roll back the transaction if an error occurs
            print(f"Error: {e}")  # Print the error message

## Why Use Transactions?

- **Data Integrity:** Ensures that all operations are completed successfully before committing changes.
- **Atomicity:** Treats operations within a transaction as a single unit.
- **Error Handling:** Allows for graceful handling of errors with rollback capabilities.

## Conclusion

The use of transactions in the `add_product` method enhances reliability and integrity in database operations, ensuring safe product insertion and effective error management.
