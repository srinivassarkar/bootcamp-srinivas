# Basic Transaction Management in SQLite

## Overview

This code defines a function `basic_transaction` that demonstrates how to perform basic transaction management in a SQLite database by inserting multiple products into the `products` table.

## Key Components

*   **Database Connection:** Establishes a connection to the SQLite database.
*   **Transaction Management:** Uses a transaction to ensure that multiple insert operations are treated as a single unit of work.
*   **Error Handling:** Catches errors and rolls back the transaction if any issues occur during the insertions.
*   **Closing Connection:** Ensures the database connection is closed after operations are complete.


## Approach Simplification

The approach can be simplified into the following steps:

1.  Establish a connection to the SQLite database.
2.  Begin a transaction to ensure that all operations are treated as a single unit.
3.  Execute multiple insert statements to add products to the database.
4.  Commit the transaction if all operations succeed; otherwise, roll back in case of an error.
5.  Close the database connection after operations are complete.
