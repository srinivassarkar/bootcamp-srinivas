      <h2>Simple Summary</h2>
      <p>
        The blog explains why relational database management systems (RDBMS) are
        widely used for web applications, despite their complexity and cost. It
        compares RDBMS to simpler alternatives like file systems and flat-file
        databases, highlighting key features such as transaction processing
        (ACID properties), indexing, and SQL. The blog also discusses
        object-relational and object-oriented databases, explaining their pros
        and cons.

      <h2>Technological Definition</h2>
      <p>
        A <strong>Relational Database Management System (RDBMS)</strong> is a
        software system that manages data stored in tables (relations) and uses
        Structured Query Language (SQL) for querying and manipulating data. It
        ensures data integrity, supports concurrent access, and provides
        features like indexing, transactions (ACID properties), and declarative
        querying. RDBMS is designed to handle large-scale, structured data
        efficiently, making it a cornerstone of modern web applications and
        enterprise systems.

      <h2>10 Key Points to Remember</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>File Systems vs. RDBMS:</strong> File systems are simple but
          lack concurrency control, indexing, and transaction management. RDBMS
          provides structured data storage and robust data management.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>ACID Properties:</strong>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <strong>Atomicity:</strong> Ensures all parts of a transaction are
              completed or none are.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Consistency:</strong> Maintains data integrity by
              enforcing rules and constraints.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Isolation:</strong> Ensures transactions donâ€™t interfere
              with each other.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Durability:</strong> Guarantees that committed
              transactions are permanently saved.
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Indexing:</strong> Indexes speed up data retrieval but require
          maintenance during inserts, updates, and deletes. Without indexing,
          querying large datasets can be slow.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>SQL (Structured Query Language):</strong> A declarative
          language used to interact with RDBMS. It allows users to define what
          data they need without specifying how to retrieve it.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Concurrency Control:</strong> RDBMS handles multiple users
          accessing and modifying data simultaneously, preventing data
          corruption.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Relational Model:</strong> Data is stored in tables with rows
          and columns. Relationships between tables are established using keys
          (primary and foreign keys).
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Object-Relational and Object Databases:</strong>
          Object-relational databases extend RDBMS to support custom data types.
          Object databases store data as objects but are less popular due to
          complexity.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Data Integrity:</strong> RDBMS enforces constraints (e.g.,
          primary keys, foreign keys, and check constraints) to ensure data
          accuracy and consistency.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Performance Considerations:</strong> RDBMS performance depends
          on proper indexing, query optimization, and hardware resources.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Evolution of Databases:</strong> RDBMS evolved from
          hierarchical and network databases of the 1960s. Despite newer
          technologies, RDBMS remains dominant due to its reliability and
          scalability.
